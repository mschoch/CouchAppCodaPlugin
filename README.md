### CouchApp Coda Plug-in

A plug-in for the Coda editor which offers minimal support for working on CouchApp projects.

### Limitations

* Only supports the `couchapp push` operation
* Relies on the user defining a "Site" in Coda corresponding to the root of the CouchApp
* Path to `couchapp` executable is hard-coded
